          <h1>Mumbai - The City Of Dreams & Affection</h1>

          <p>
            Mumbai isn’t just the wealthiest city in the country, but among the
            wealthiest globally. It is where the headquarters of multiple
            financial institutions are located – from the Bombay Stock Exchange,
            Reserve Bank of India, National Stock Exchange, and the Mint, to
            Indian business giants such as the Tata Group, Aditya Birla Group,
            Essel Group and Reliance Industries
          </p>
          <p>
            As the commercial capital of the country, Mumbai has much appeal to
            anyone in search of work and better career prospects. Migrants from
            every part of the country move to the city every day in search of a
            better life, hence the name ‘City of Dreams’ was coined. In spite of
            its many slums and alarming extremes in wealth distribution, it is
            seen as a city that will reward anyone who is willing to work hard.

              Mumbai is synonymous with Mayanagri or the ‘City of Dreams’ not
              just for the people of India, but for many well beyond the billion
              strong country’s borders.
            </p>

            From the stunning Bandra-Worli Sea link to the pristine white Haji
            Ali Dargah, Mumbai’s architecture is complex, rich and exceptional.
            Marine Drive whose lights form an arc resembling a string of pearls
            dubbed as Queen’s Necklace, and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus
            whose Victorian architecture has resiliently stood through more than
            a century of events from terror attacks to freedom struggles – are
            all symbolic of Mumbai’s charm to the rest of the subcontinent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bollywood, India’s largest and one of the world’s largest film
            industries is synonymous with Mumbai. The city has accordingly
            established itself as the film capital of India. It is where many
            Bollywood storylines are based, where top studios are located and
            where the most famous directors, producers, actors and crew members
            live. And so, to the rest of India the charm and appeal of Bollywood
            holds true for Mumbai as well.
